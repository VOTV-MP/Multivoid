# 08 — HOST-AUTHORITATIVE TRASH CHANNEL (the pile-sync redesign)

## ⚠ THE "OBSERVABILITY REVERSAL" WAS FALSE — corrected 2026-06-21 (read this first)

The earlier-this-session draft of this doc claimed an **"observability reversal":** that the chipPile/clump
`BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` POST (and `FinishSpawningActor` POST) is **observable** to our
ProcessEvent hook, so `host_spawn_watcher` could catch the grab (pile→clump) and the re-pile (clump→pile) at
that POST as a "deterministic, zero-proximity link". **That claim is FALSE.** It was the central design pillar
of Increment 1; it never worked.

- **Why it's false (the dispatch truth):** the chipPile clump-spawn (inside `actorChipPile_C::playerGrabbed`)
  and the pile-respawn (inside the `prop_garbageClump_C` ubergraph) are dispatched in the bytecode as
  **`EX_CallMath`** — a native thunk invoked via `UObject::CallFunction → UFunction::Invoke →
  (Context->*UFunction::Func)(...)`, which is **one layer BELOW `UObject::ProcessEvent`**, our sole hook seam.
  An `EX_CallMath` call never re-enters ProcessEvent, so a POST observer registered on `BeginDeferred` for
  this caller **never fires.** [V]
- **Visibility is a property of the CALLER's opcode, not the callee UFunction.** `host_spawn_watcher` DOES
  catch `BeginDeferred` for the `garbagePileSpawner` / ambient (pinecone) caller — because THAT caller's
  dispatch reaches ProcessEvent. The chipPile/clump caller issues the SAME UFunction as `EX_CallMath` →
  invisible. "Catches it for the pinecone, therefore catches it for the clump" was a category error. [V]
- **The 2026-06-08 pass-2 RE already had this right** (`findings/votv-clump-lifecycle-observability-and-
  robust-design-2026-06-08-pass2.md` §1.1 + §2 row 4: `EX_CallMath … Observable: NO`). The s35/08 redesign
  CONTRADICTED our own earlier correct RE. **[RD → confirmed]**
- **Live proof (hands-on 2026-06-21):** `host_spawn_watcher` registered the POST observer fine but logged
  **0 fires** across 870 piles + every re-pile. Committed in `0e56ca39`; full RE in
  `research/findings/votv-chippile-dispatch-and-thunk-hook-RE-2026-06-21.md`. **[V]**

**Consequence:** `host_spawn_watcher` was reverted to owning the AMBIENT/pinecone BeginDeferred POST ONLY (the
chipPile/clump convert link was removed from it). The grab + re-pile now sync via the **VISIBLE** seams
(below). The ZERO-proximity catch is still achievable — but only by patching `UFunction::Func` (the thunk),
NOT by a ProcessEvent observer (the DESIGN in the last section).

> **WorldContextObject is still the right data — it was the SEAM that was wrong.** WorldContextObject ==
> `EX_Self` (the source actor) is bytecode-confirmed for BOTH transitions (the chipPile playerGrabbed
> clump-spawn; the prop_garbageClump ubergraph pile-spawn). Reading it gives the source entity for free. The
> blocker is purely that the spawn is `EX_CallMath` (invisible to ProcessEvent) — addressed by the thunk hook.

## The VERIFIED mechanic (byte-exact — bytecode + SDK + live log)

**`actorChipPile_C` = CARRY-AND-THROW** (never collected — every collect/pickup/hold verb is
hard-false/no-op). **`trashBitsPile_C` = COLLECT** (a SEPARATE entity: `playerTryToCollect` → `trashToProp` →
spawn one `Aprop_C` + decrement count + self-destroy at 0; rides the existing keyed-Aprop lane — do NOT force
it through the carry channel).

```
PILE (actorChipPile_C; keyless; chipType@0x0238; fresh-load pos is map-deterministic)
  └─[E-press; lookAtActor==pile]→ playerGrabbed @2607: BeginDeferred(clump) @2748 ·
       clump.chipType:=pile.chipType @2790 · clump.holdPlayer:=player @2831 · FinishSpawning @3013 ·
       player.pickupObjectDirect(clump) @3051 · K2_DestroyActor(self=pile) @2563
       ⇒ CLUMP-HELD   [spawn 1 clump, destroy 1 pile; ONLY chipType carried]
CLUMP-HELD (prop_garbageClump_C; keyless; holdPlayer set; held via PHC grabHandle)
  ├─ convert ABORTS while the holder is still grabbing (@2927 gate)
  ├─[E-press on a NEW pile]→ grabbing_actor reassigned; THIS clump silently RELEASED (NO merge) ⇒ FLYING
  └─[grab decays / drop]→ grabbing_actor:=null; PHC release ⇒ FLYING  (residual sim vel ~34cm/s —
       NOT a thrown impulse; the PHC just lets go as it settles)
CLUMP-FLYING (simulating; grabbing_actor null)
  └─[OnComponentHit #1]→ delayOnHit:=false @2716   (ARM ONLY — no convert on the 1st contact)
  └─[OnComponentHit #2; canConvert && !holder.grabbing_actor && Dot(N,Up)>0.75 && !hitComp.IsSimulating]
       SphereTrace(10cm)→restingXform @27 · BeginDeferred(pile,restingXform) @1722 ·
       pile.chipType:=clump.chipType @1764 · FinishSpawning @2557 · pile.SetLifeSpan @2595 ·
       K2_DestroyActor(self=clump) @2640
       ⇒ PILE (NEW, at the clump's SPHERE-TRACED RESTING POINT — NOT lastPos, NOT the source pile pos)
```

**Why proximity-from-lastPos was doomed:** the re-pile is at the clump's **resting point**, not `lastPos`; a
2nd grab while holding **replaces, never merges**; only `chipType` (a cosmetic variant @0x0238) carries — it
is NOT a unique id. Piles are keyless (`Key=None`); identity must be our eid. **[V/RD]**

## OBSERVABILITY (corrected — every grab/spawn/destroy verb is INVISIBLE; the inputs + the hit delegate are VISIBLE)

- **INVISIBLE** (inner BP-VM calls, below our ProcessEvent detour — `EX_LocalVirtualFunction` →
  ProcessInternal, or `EX_CallMath` → native thunk):
  - `playerGrabbed`, `pickupObjectDirect`, both `K2_DestroyActor(self)` (`EX_*VirtualFunction`). **[V/RD]**
  - **`BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` + `FinishSpawningActor`** when called from the chipPile/clump
    ubergraphs (`EX_CallMath`). **THIS is the FALSE-claim correction** — the grab clump-spawn and the
    re-pile pile-spawn are NOT observable to our hook (§"observability reversal was FALSE" above). **[V]**
  - A reflection `CallFunction(InpActEvt_use)` fires our PRE/POST observer but NOT the input-gated BP body
    (see COOP_DISPATCH_VISIBILITY observe-vs-drive). **[V]**
- **VISIBLE** (OUTER entries — reach ProcessEvent, our detour fires):
  - `InpActEvt_use` PRE/POST — the one observable grab-INTENT seam (pile alive at PRE). **This is the seam
    the AS-BUILT grab uses.** **[V]**
  - `prop_garbageClump_C::BndEvt__…ComponentHit` — the land trigger (a multicast-delegate broadcast →
    ProcessEvent). Candidate-VISIBLE (pass-2 §1.2). Used only as the thunk-hook FALLBACK (not on the AS-BUILT
    path). **[RD]**
  - `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` POST **for the `garbagePileSpawner` / ambient (pinecone) caller** —
    host_spawn_watcher catches THIS caller (its dispatch reaches PE). The chipPile/clump caller does NOT
    reach here. **[V]**
  - `reflection::CallFunction(player, playerGrabbed, frame)` re-enters PE and runs the REAL verb — the
    mechanism for the host to execute a client's grab intent (Increment 2). **[V]**

## THE ARCHITECTURE — host-authoritative trash-entity state machine

MTA single-syncer + sync-time-context, **structurally cloned from the shipped door channel**
(`interactable_channel.h:220 OnRequest`, `Channel::Mode::HostAuth`). Principle 6 / the door rule: the
non-authority moves ONLY on host echoes.

**Data model — the eid is a host-minted, life-stable logical trash entity** (re-skinned in place
pile↔clump↔pile; keep `oldEid==newEid==E`). **Position is NEVER identity anywhere** → the cluster mis-bind is
impossible by construction.

```
TrashEntity { eid; state(PILED@xform | HELD_BY(slot N) | FLYING(vel)); chipType; xform; ctx(uint8) }
```
The host owns the authoritative state; every receiver (incl. a client that initiated a grab) drives a LOCAL
visual actor from that state — never advances state locally, never guesses identity by proximity.

**Cluster-safe identity, NO proximity:**
1. **eid end-to-end.** The clump↔pile link rebinds the SAME E in place (`oldEid==newEid==E`); no spatial
   search keys identity. (AS-BUILT: the grab uses the InpActEvt-PRE eid; the re-pile is now the
   `UFunction::Func` thunk converter — it reads the exact `(source clump, spawned pile)` pair off the
   `EX_CallMath BeginDeferred` and converts E onto the spawned pile the same tick, zero spatial search. The
   former proximity death-watch is RETIRED.)
2. **MTA sync-time-context (`ctx` byte).** Stamp every PropConvert/Pose/Release; bump on EVERY transition;
   receivers drop stale-ctx packets (port `CElement::GenerateSyncTimeContext`/`CanUpdateSync`, MTA
   `CElement.cpp:1281/1300`). A late pose/land packet for eid E after a transition is REJECTED — never
   re-applied to a neighbor. (The single guard the morph lacked.) **[V — AS-BUILT, proto v82.]**
3. **Drain survival (MTA EntityAdd-on-rescope).** On the shadow-drain edge the client sends
   `PileResyncRequest`; the host re-streams `PropSpawn` per live pile (host eid preserved). **[DESIGN —
   Increment 2.]**

**Packets (both directions symmetric through the host):**
```
HOST → ALL (authoritative state change):
  PropConvert{eid, kind(kToClump|kToPile), ctx, xform, chipType}   // [V] AS-BUILT
  PropPose{eid, ctx}                      // carry (existing held-pose stream + ctx) // [V] AS-BUILT
  PropRelease{eid, vel, ctx}              // throw                                    // [V] AS-BUILT
  PropSpawn{eid, class, xform, chipType}  // (re)scope-in incl. resync reply          // [V] existing
  PropDestroy{eid}                        // collect/despawn (no re-pile)             // [V] AS-BUILT
CLIENT → HOST (intent/request, NOT a state push):                                    // [DESIGN] Increment 2
  GrabIntent{eid}   ThrowIntent{eid}   PileResyncRequest{}
```

**Host-grab** (host is authority AND grabber) — **[V] VERIFIED** (grab) **+ [AS-BUILT]** (re-pile):
`InpActEvt_use` PRE resolves the aimed pile's eid → records it as a pending grab → the held-object edge
adopts the spawned clump onto E, bumps ctx, broadcasts `PropConvert{kToClump}`. Carry streams `PropPose`
(ctx-stamped). Throw → `PropRelease`. Land caught by the **`UFunction::Func` thunk converter** (commit
`d19ae4d4`; detection VERIFIED, convert deployed-pending-hands-on) → `PropConvert{kToPile, xform}`.

**Client-grab** (the dead direction — the door `OnRequest` pattern verbatim) — **[DESIGN] Increment 2**:
```
client InpActEvt_use PRE: SUPPRESS the native BP grab for THIS dispatch (null lookAtActor — the
   device_screen ClearAimForDispatch analog — so icast(lookAtActor)→playerGrabbed fails, NO local
   clump spawns; this kills the local eid=0 dupe at the source), then send GrabIntent{eid}.
host OnGrabIntent (role==Host): validate state==PILED && !HELD (per-peer guard, door holdOpen_ analog);
   EXECUTE the real grab on puppet-N: reflection::CallFunction(pile, playerGrabbed, {puppetN, hit});
   PILED→HELD_BY(N); bump ctx; broadcast PropConvert{kToClump} to ALL incl. the requester.
every peer mirrors the host's authoritative convert ⇒ ONE actor per eid, no local dupe.
```
This single move fixes BOTH the dead client direction AND the local-clump dupe (the proven door fix).

**MTA precedent (cited):** `CObjectSync.cpp` single-syncer (`GetSyncer`/`SetSyncer` :47/:140, syncer-gated
`Packet_ObjectSync` :214, re-broadcast :234); `CStaticFunctionDefinitions.cpp` `AttachElements`/`Detach`
:1602/:1656 (host-broadcast carry transition by ID :1644 + ctx on transition :1689); `CElement.cpp`
`GenerateSyncTimeContext`/`CanUpdateSync` :1281/:1300. In-tree proven instance: the door channel
(`interactable_channel.h:220`, `interactable_sync.cpp:221-290`). All driven by reflected UFunctions + state
push — no BP-asset edits, no Replicated props/RPCs, no pak edits (A6 respected).

---

## AS-BUILT — Increment 1 (the s38 thunk re-pile + grab-cue; HEAD was `fea04c26` on `BA79E705`, now folded into the deployed proxy build `69405445`, proto v82; the thunk landed `d19ae4d4`)

**Grab via the VISIBLE InpActEvt seam; re-pile via the deterministic `UFunction::Func` thunk (the
BeginDeferred-POST ProcessEvent link DISPROVEN + removed; the proximity death-watch RETIRED).** Per
[[feedback-docs-piles-living-knowledge-base]] "AS-BUILT" ≠ "VERIFIED": the GRAB is VERIFIED (a real hands-on
`[SYNC-MIRROR OK]`); the RE-PILE thunk DETECTION is VERIFIED (a read-only observe pass agreed ptr-for-ptr
with the old death-watch); the RE-PILE CONVERT flip + the triple-sound fix are AS-BUILT, deployed,
hands-on-PENDING.

### What shipped

- **Protocol v82** (`coop/net/protocol.h`): a per-eid MTA sync-time-context `ctx` byte on
  `PropConvertPayload`, `PropPoseSnapshot` (60→64), `PropReleasePayload` (56→60). `Session::SendPropRelease`
  takes a `ctx` param. **[V] KEPT — this part holds, unchanged by the disproof.**
- **`coop/trash_channel.{cpp,h}`** (ctx generator + stale-packet guard + the per-eid rebind primitive):
  `OnHostConvert` (bump ctx + rebind E in place + broadcast PropConvert), `OnHostRelease` (bump on throw),
  `NotePendingGrab` / `AdoptPendingGrabClump` (the grab eid hand-off), `CtxForEid` (carry stamp),
  `AdoptInboundConvertCtx` / `IsInboundStreamCtxFresh` (receiver drop-if-stale, wrap-aware int8, 0 =
  no-enforcement sentinel). **[V]**
- **GRAB (pile→clump) — [V] VERIFIED:** `trash_collect_sync::OnPileGrabPre` (the `InpActEvt_use` PRE observer
  — a REAL input event, ProcessEvent-VISIBLE, which is why it works) reads the aimed pile (alive at PRE) and,
  on the host, records its eid via `trash_channel::NotePendingGrab`. `local_streams`' new-held edge adopts the
  spawned clump onto that eid via `trash_channel::AdoptPendingGrabClump → OnHostConvert(kToClump)`. Identity
  is the host eid end-to-end; NO proximity. (`[SYNC-MIRROR OK]` in the client log.)
- **RE-PILE (clump→pile) — [AS-BUILT], the DETERMINISTIC `UFunction::Func` thunk converter (commit
  `d19ae4d4`):** a process-lifetime patch on `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass`'s `Func` (`UFunction+0xD8`)
  installs a transparent forwarder (`ue_wrap/ufunction_hook`). On a host re-pile the clump's
  `EX_CallMath BeginDeferred(self=clump, pile)` fires the thunk → `OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve` reads
  `FFrame::Object` (@0x18 = the re-piling clump = `WorldContextObject` = `EX_Self`) + `*Result` (the new
  pile); if the clump is a TRACKED trash entity (eid E) it `OnHostConvert(E, kToPile)` converts E onto the
  EXACT spawned pile the SAME tick it is constructed → the client re-skins its ONE mirror (no destroy+spawn
  dupe), **zero proximity, no reaper race**. An UNTRACKED clump (the grab-adopt miss, eid=0) is skipped. The
  thunk DETECTION is VERIFIED (read-only pass `B7EEB1BF`: many CLEAN `[REPILE]`, `*Result` ptr-for-ptr ==
  the old death-watch's FindNearest pile on every isolated re-pile); the CONVERT flip is hands-on-PENDING.
- **The proximity death-watch RETIRED (RULE 2, same commit):** `WatchClumpForRepile` / `Tick` /
  `FindNearestUntrackedChipPile_` / `g_watchedClumps` + the `local_streams` enroll + the `subsystems` tick +
  the `trash_collect_sync.h` decls are DELETED — no window with two live converters. A thread-local
  re-entrancy guard (`t_inCb`) in `ufunction_hook.cpp` keeps a nested spawn from double-converting.
- **`host_spawn_watcher` — the chipPile/clump link REMOVED** (reverted to the ambient/pinecone BeginDeferred
  POST only; the comment at `:118-122` records why: EX_CallMath, invisible to the ProcessEvent hook). **[V]**
- **MORPH DELETED (RULE 2):** `coop/pile_morph.{cpp,h}` git-removed; `trash_collect_sync::OnPileGrabPre` is
  now PROBE-A + the host pending-grab note (logs role / aimed eid / the carry slot `grabbing_actor` vs
  `holding_actor` for Increment 2); `local_streams` carries E's pose (ctx-stamped) for an adopted clump;
  `remote_prop::OnConvert` adopts ctx + drops stale; `subsystems` ticks `TickPendingGrab` + adds
  `trash_channel::OnDisconnect`. **[V]**

### KNOWN minor — RESOLVED by the thunk (2026-06-21)

The interim ~5 s vanish-return (the reaper death-watch racing the convert rebind) is **gone by
construction**: the thunk converter rebinds E onto the new pile the SAME tick it is constructed, so the
reaper never sees E dead between the clump's death and the pile's rebind. (Confirm absent at the next
hands-on alongside the single-grab-cue check.)

---

## AS-BUILT — the deterministic re-pile via a `UFunction::Func` thunk hook (committed `d19ae4d4`)

Catch the `EX_CallMath BeginDeferred` itself by patching the callee's thunk (a ProcessEvent observer provably
can't — that's the whole point of the disproof). Full RE + the IDA-pinned offsets + the validation result:
**`research/findings/votv-chippile-dispatch-and-thunk-hook-RE-2026-06-21.md`** §3 (now AS-BUILT). As built:

- **`ue_wrap/ufunction_hook.{h,cpp}`** — the standalone Func-patch facility (principle 7, engine substrate).
  `InstallPostHook(ufn, cb)` saves the original `Func` (@`UFunction+0xD8`) and writes a STAMPED transparent
  thunk (`NativeThunk<N>`, one per slot, ≤4) that reads `FFrame::Object` (@0x18) BEFORE forwarding, runs the
  original (transparent — the spawn proceeds), then passes `(srcObj, *Result)` to the callback under an SEH
  guard + a thread-local re-entrancy guard. Refuses to patch if `Func` reads null (wrong offset for the
  build). Offsets `off::UFunction_Func`/`off::FFrame_Object` pinned in `sdk_profile.h`.
- **`trash_collect_sync::OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve`** is the converter: installed in `Install` via
  `ufunction_hook::InstallPostHook(BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass, …)`. Filters
  `IsGarbageClump(srcObj) && IsChipPile(newActor) && GetPropElementIdForActor(srcObj) != invalid`; on a
  TRACKED clump re-pile → `OnHostConvert(E, kToPile, newActor, loc=clumpResting, rot, chipType)`. The grab
  case (srcObj=pile) is skipped here (the host grab stays on the InpActEvt-PRE + held-edge adopt). **Zero
  proximity, same tick.** Game-thread (BeginDeferred is GT-only), process-lifetime, host-only.
- **VALIDATION — DONE (read-only pass, deployed `B7EEB1BF`, 2026-06-21):** the thunk ran as a pure logger;
  the host log showed many CLEAN `[REPILE]` (worldCtx a tracked garbageClump + Result a chipPile, eid
  cross-check perfect) and the thunk's `*Result` was ptr-for-ptr the SAME pile the death-watch's FindNearest
  found on every isolated re-pile. Two independent paths agreeing → the convert was flipped on + the
  death-watch atomically deleted in `d19ae4d4` (RULE 2 — no parallel paths). The CONVERT itself is
  hands-on-PENDING (the user tests next).

When the GRAB direction moves to the same thunk too (srcObj = a tracked chipPile, newActor = clump →
kToClump), it retires the InpActEvt-PRE + held-edge adopt AND closes the eid=0 adopt-miss gap (an UNTRACKED
clump from a grab the PRE missed currently skips the converter) — the NEXT tightening, unbuilt.

---

## Increment 2 — the CLIENT-grab direction (DESIGN, NOT built, proto v83)

The suppress-native + `GrabIntent` → host-executes-on-puppet-N path (the door `OnRequest` shape, above) + the
PILED/HELD/FLYING state machine + the drain-resync (`PileResyncRequest`). Protocol v83. **[DESIGN.]** The
PROBE-A diagnostic (`OnPileGrabPre` logs the carry slot `grabbing_actor` vs `holding_actor`) feeds this — the
client suppress + GrabIntent send is added at that exact seam.

Open [?] (verify during Increment 2): does `reflection::CallFunction(pile, playerGrabbed, {puppetN, hit})` on
a PUPPET drive `pickupObjectDirect` so puppet-N visibly holds the clump on the host (the verb is
VISIBLE-re-entrant → exercisable in the smoke)?

---

## How to VERIFY for real (the smoke the morph faked)

The morph's smoke false-passed by calling `playerGrabbed` directly on ONE sanitized pile — never the cluster,
never the input seam, never the client direction. The real gates:
1. **Real input seam** (drive `InpActEvt_use` / key-inject so the PRE actually runs) — an interaction smoke,
   not a join smoke ([[feedback-interaction-smoke-not-join-smoke]]). **(GRAB met: `[SYNC-MIRROR OK]`.)**
2. **A CLUSTER** — 4+ piles within ~30cm. Grab one, carry, throw to re-pile among neighbors; assert exactly
   ONE actor per eid on BOTH peers + the re-pile bound to the CORRECT eid.
3. **BOTH directions** — host-grab→client-mirror (DONE) AND client-grab→host-executes→both-mirror (Increment
   2); assert the host pile actually disappears on a client grab.
4. **Pre-handoff checklist (RULE 2026-05-27):** hot-path re-entry table, `wc -l` modularity, deploy ×4, ≥30s
   LAN smoke via the named-window launchers, host+client log diff clean, RSS stable; audit agents.
5. **User hands-on is the final gate.** "Works" only after that, NEVER from a smoke. (GRAB cleared this;
   the RE-PILE thunk DETECTION cleared the read-only gate; the RE-PILE CONVERT + the triple-sound fix are
   deployed-PENDING — the next hands-on confirms the grab cue is SINGLE and the re-pile no longer
   vanish-returns.)

## AS-BUILT — the client trash MIRROR is the host-authoritative `AStaticMeshActor` proxy (phase 1) — DUP-FIX + VISIBILITY hands-on VERIFIED; the LIVE CARRY is NOT fixed (the contact-re-pile churn)

**HEAD `70d28df4`, deployed `8bc797ef` (proto v82 unchanged). [AS-BUILT].** Commits `06685a9c` (core) +
`1011e512` (leak) + `3d371349` (HIGH-1/2 + MEDIUM-1) + `095dbf44` (lerp/freeze/teardown) + `8a17faeb` (HOT-1)
+ `245148c6` (the VISIBILITY/Movable fix) + `8bc797ef` (option 1 — BUILT + FAILED); harness `4a1f42a6` +
`f1177589` + `cfdd7745`. Per [[feedback-docs-piles-living-knowledge-base]] "AS-BUILT" ≠ "VERIFIED".
- **DUP FIX — [V] VERIFIED hands-on.** No doubled piles; resting + landed piles mirror correctly. (Smoke: `0`
  `mirror NOT-FOUND`, 875 proxies, no crash/leak, 300 s stable; the user confirmed it works visually.)
- **VISIBILITY — [V] VERIFIED hands-on (`245148c6`).** A runtime-spawned `AStaticMeshActor` defaults to
  STATIC mobility, on which `SetStaticMesh`+`SetActorLocation` silently no-op → the proxies were INVISIBLE in
  the (render-blind) smoke. Fixed with `engine::SetComponentMobility(Movable)`; user then confirmed "works
  visually." [[lesson-runtime-staticmeshactor-must-be-movable]]
- **THE LIVE CLUMP CARRY — [?] NOT fixed (the contact-re-pile churn).** The earlier "carry MIRRORS on a settled
  join / the failure was the JOIN RACE" claim is **WITHDRAWN as FALSE.** When the host grabs + carries a pile
  via a real **E-press**, the clump rides **`holding_actor`**, so the native re-pile gate (`@2927` checks
  `holdPlayer.grabbing_actor`, null here) **never aborts** → the held clump **RE-PILES on cluster contact ~1/s**
  (`StaticMesh.OnComponentHit`) → the game auto-re-grabs → **CHURN**; each `OnHostConvert` teleports the client
  proxy (`ClearAnyDriveFor` + `SetActorLocation`) → the client's clump movement + morphs run **0.5–2 fps** + an
  old pile lingers. **Host carries FINE** (native; the churn is seamless); **OTHER physics props mirror fine**;
  **ONLY the chipPile** (the lone convert-machine mirror) is broken **client-side**. This is **stock VOTV**
  behaviour (a held clump re-piles on contact) — NOT a coop bug in the re-pile; the client just shouldn't
  mirror it. The two clean smokes (`b97z33gyh`/`b7oxr23uy`) LIED because `autotest_chippile.cpp` grabs via
  `playerGrabbed` → the clump lands in `grabbing_actor` → the gate aborts → no churn (the wrong,
  non-representative grab slot); render-blind + wrong slot = the false "proven." **Option 1** (`8bc797ef`,
  `SetNotifyRigidBodyCollision(false)` on the held clump) BUILT + FAILED — the live host BP re-arms hit-notify.
  **Option 2 (DESIGN LOCKED, NOT BUILT):** gate the convert **broadcast AND the ctx bump** in `OnHostConvert`
  by the clump's **`holdPlayer`** field (`@0x0240 AmainPlayer_C*`, CXXHeaderDump-confirmed) — `clump→pile`
  suppressed while `holdPlayer` non-null (churn re-pile); `pile→clump` suppressed while a per-eid "carrying"
  flag is set (churn re-grab); keep the local rebind → removes the CLIENT lag (the HOST churn stays, transient
  + self-cleaning). The root + the fix design: the new canonical finding
  **`research/findings/votv-chippile-carry-churn-holdplayer-gate-2026-06-22.md`**. Do NOT mark the live carry
  VERIFIED — it is NOT fixed; there is no carry hands-on pending until option 2 is built.

### The dup this fixes (the ROBUSTNESS track — was OPEN, now addressed BY CONSTRUCTION)

The client's mirror of a trash entity USED to be a **real `actorChipPile_C` / `prop_garbageClump_C`
blueprint**. That BP runs its OWN ubergraph → it self-morphs / self-destructs / is GC-eligible (unrooted) on
its own schedule, independent of the host. Within ~10 s it went **NOT-LIVE** → on the next `OnConvert`,
`ResolveLiveActorByEid` returned null → "mirror NOT-FOUND" → the client spawned a FRESH clump while the
original lingered = the visible DUP (RCA: the eid=4424 lifecycle in the design finding §1). This is a
CLIENT-side staleness problem — **distinct** from the host-side cluster mis-bind the thunk flip fixes.

### The fix — change the mirror's RULES OF EXISTENCE (NEW `coop/trash_proxy.{cpp,h}`)

The client mirror of trash (chipPile/clump + variants) is now an **`AStaticMeshActor` WE own**, NOT the real
BP:
- **NO blueprint** → never self-morphs / self-destructs.
- **`AddToRoot`** → never GC'd → never stale-index (`trash_proxy.cpp:119`).
- **our eid→actor registry** (`g_proxies`) → on convert we **re-skin (`SetStaticMesh`) IN PLACE**, never
  spawn-fresh → the "mirror NOT-FOUND → spawn fresh" dup path is **structurally unreachable**.

So the dup is impossible by construction; the earlier 3-verdict discriminator / health-poll / serial-check
plan (design finding §4) is **DROPPED as moot**.

**Phase 1 scope: visual + position + re-skin, EXPLICIT NoCollision** (`SetActorRootCollisionEnabled(actor,
0)`, `trash_proxy.cpp:120`). The proxy is a kinematic host-driven follower; the client player TEMPORARILY
passes through mirrored trash (an accepted phase-1 regression, design §Q1). Collision (the `garbageCollider`
double-duty hull — Pawn-block + grab-trace) is **PHASE 2** with the client-grab direction (Increment 2).
Scope: trash only; `Aprop_C` + kerfur mirrors unchanged.

### As-built pieces (file:line)

- **`coop/trash_proxy.{cpp,h}`** — owns the eid→proxy registry + the rooting. `SpawnProxy` (idempotent: a
  same-eid re-spawn re-skins instead of leaking a second, `:107-112`) / `ReskinProxy` (in place, binding
  untouched, `:130-138`) / `RetireProxy` (`ClearAnyDriveFor → DestroyActor → RemoveFromRoot → unbind`, the
  GC-window order, `:140-163`) / `IsTrashProxyClass` / `IsClumpClass` (one cached `ClassKind` lookup) /
  `IsProxy` / `OnDisconnect` (all proxies) / `OnDisconnectForSlot` (per-slot, the CRITICAL-1 fix).
- **ue_wrap foundation:** `reflection::RemoveFromRoot`, `engine::SetStaticMesh` +
  `engine::GetStaticMeshComponent`, `prop::ResolvePileMesh` (the game's OWN `getChipPileType(chipType)`
  resolver, last-good-cached).
- **Wiring:**
  - `remote_prop_spawn.cpp` `OnSpawn` — trash class → `SpawnProxy` + `RegisterPropMirror`, branched BEFORE the
    BP dedup/converge/physics machinery (`:343-364`).
  - `remote_prop.cpp` `OnConvert` — `IsProxy(E)` → `ReskinProxy` in place → return — **THE dup fix**.
  - `remote_prop.cpp` `OnDestroy` — `IsProxy(E)` → `RetireProxy` → return (un-roots the rooted actor).
  - `subsystems.cpp` `DisconnectSlot` — `OnDisconnectForSlot(slot)` before the generic per-slot mirror drain;
    `DisconnectAll` — `OnDisconnect()` before `ForceRelease`.

### Audit `a249b005` (post-ship): CRITICAL fixed; then ALL the pre-smoke fixes + the lerp BUILT

- **CRITICAL-1 — FIXED (`1011e512`):** a PER-SLOT disconnect drained a proxy's Prop Element WITHOUT
  `RetireProxy` → the rooted `AStaticMeshActor` leaked. Fixed via `OnDisconnectForSlot(slot)` (retire by
  `ownerSlot`, stamped from `senderSlot` at spawn) running BEFORE the generic drain. (The design's Q2 claimed
  this "structurally impossible" — it was the gap.) MEDIUM-2 (cache the component) + MEDIUM-3 (fold the class
  cache) also FIXED.
- **HIGH-1/HIGH-2/MEDIUM-1 — ALL BUILT (`3d371349`):** HIGH-1 = `OnConvert` spawns the proxy in the
  unambiguous `wantClump` form on a convert-before-spawn AND `SpawnProxy` convergence no longer re-skins (the
  form is owned by the ctx-ordered convert channel, so a stale trailing spawn can't flip a clump back to a
  pile). HIGH-2 = bytecode-VERIFIED `setTex` (`prop_garbageClump.json` export 64 = `StaticMesh.SetMaterial(0,
  getChipPileType(chipType).GetMaterial(0))` on the fixed dirtball — a MATERIAL swap); new
  `engine::SetComponentMaterial` + `GetStaticMeshMaterial` (SDK-exact); `SkinProxy` clump = dirtball + the
  material, pile = mesh + `SetMaterial(0,null)`. MEDIUM-1 = Cube last-ditch fallback (`StaticLoadObject` deemed
  unwarranted — a loaded trash class pins its meshes resident).
- **R4 km-walk lerp + reliable carry-end release — ALL BUILT (`095dbf44` + HOT-1 `8a17faeb`):** MTA-style
  interpolation scoped to the proxy (`BeginLerpToPose`/`AdvanceLerp`, advanced every tick; non-proxy keeps
  teleport); the 500 ms timeout-release gated to `!isProxy` so a host-authoritative proxy FREEZES on a network
  gap and releases only on the explicit reliable edge (throw / ToPile convert / disconnect); proxy throw =
  freeze + the ToPile convert repositions to the landed pile; the destroy-only-via-`RetireProxy` invariant
  hardened (ForceRelease + OnDisconnectForSlot proxy-aware). HOT-1 dirty-gate skips sub-epsilon writes.
  **NOT meaningfully exercised by a real carry:** the settled-join smoke drove a clean `#1..#540 [proxy]` only
  because its `playerGrabbed` grab suppressed the re-pile churn; a real E-press carry teleports the proxy every
  convert (the churn), defeating the lerp. This lerp/freeze becomes meaningful only once option 2 (the
  `holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate) suppresses the churn converts so the carry pose-stream drives smoothly.
- **Hot-path audit `aa8e7d9a` — GO (no CRITICAL/HIGH); HOT-1 folded.**
- **SMOKE — PARTIAL; the earlier "functionally green" is WITHDRAWN (the smoke is RENDER-BLIND + the autotest
  grabbed DURING the client join). SHA `f2344bab`, 2026-06-21.** What the smoke DID prove (matching real log):
  **the dup is GONE — `0` `mirror NOT-FOUND` / `spawn fresh`**, 875 proxies spawn (`AStaticMeshActor`,
  rooted), `0` proxy/drive errors, no crash/SEH/OOM, 300 s stable. The lan-test exit-1 was a harness PASS-gate
  bug (host-centric `puppet=` slot check), fixed `f1177589`+`cfdd7745`. **What the smoke did NOT prove + the
  hands-on then DISPROVED:**
  - **The proxies were INVISIBLE in the smoke.** `f2344bab` spawned them STATIC-mobility, on which
    `SetStaticMesh` no-ops at runtime; the smoke can't see render (log markers + black screenshots, the
    no-op'd `Call()` still returns true) so it passed anyway. FIXED: `SetComponentMobility(Movable)`
    (`245148c6`, build `69405445`); the user hands-on then confirmed resting + landed piles mirror VISIBLY.
  - **This raced smoke did NOT exercise the carry — the JOIN RACE, not a broken drive.** Client log:
    **`0` `GRAB-IN`** (no live proxy to drive), `reskinINPLACE=0`/`spawn-on-convert=0` (no ToClump convert
    applied), carry poses ctx-HELD. The autotest grabbed at host+40 s but the client's 875-proxy join finished
    LATER → the grab RACED the join, so this smoke never cleanly tested a post-join carry (the client joined
    AFTER the whole grab→carry→land and correctly showed the final pile). So **"the grab→carry→throw→re-pile
    cycle worked end-to-end" was WITHDRAWN at the time** — this run evidences only the dup-gone + the final
    landing. **An interim 2026-06-22 "RESOLVED — it was the JOIN RACE" conclusion (from a clean settled-join
    smoke) was WRONG and is WITHDRAWN.** That smoke drove a clean `#1..#540 [proxy]` carry only because
    `autotest_chippile.cpp` grabs via `playerGrabbed` → the clump rides `grabbing_actor` → the native re-pile
    gate aborts (`@2927`) → the autotest clump never re-piles while held → no churn. A real **E-press** carries
    the clump in `holding_actor` → the gate never fires → the held clump re-piles on cluster contact ~1/s → the
    game auto-re-grabs → CHURN, which each convert teleports on the client (0.5–2 fps). So the user's hands-on
    ("old pile not removed" / "2 fps") was REAL — the **contact-re-pile churn**, NOT a race — and the carry is
    NOT fixed. The km-walk lerp/freeze is therefore NOT meaningfully exercised by a real carry (the churn
    defeats it). **HANDS-ON `69405445` STANDS as the truth.** Root + fix (option 1 FAILED; option 2 = the
    `holdPlayer` convert/ctx gate, NOT BUILT): the new canonical finding
    `research/findings/votv-chippile-carry-churn-holdplayer-gate-2026-06-22.md`. The dup-gone + the visible
    resting/landed mirror remain the hands-on-confirmed part
    (`research/handson_runbook_2026-06-21_proxy_phase1.md`, now take-25).
