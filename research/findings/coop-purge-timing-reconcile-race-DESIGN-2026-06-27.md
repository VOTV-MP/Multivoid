# Purge-timing reconcile race (the 09:54 ghost) — root + fix design (2026-06-27)

**Status: DESIGN (on review, NOT built).** Root-cause of the 09:54 hands-on regression (ghost piles + ghost
kerfur, interaction doesn't leak to host). **b3 is INNOCENT** (proven below); do NOT roll it back. This is a
pre-existing fragility ([[feedback-snapshot-before-state-ready]] / [[feedback-recurring-bug-is-architectural]] /
docs/piles/10) bigger than b3. Logs: `research/joinwindow_09-54_{host,client}_2026-06-27.log` (09:54 ghost) vs
`research/joinwindow_16-42_{host,client}_2026-06-26.log` (worked).

## 1. The proven root (corrected — accurate this time)

A **same-world mass-purge + re-seed during the join** reaps the bound save-authoritative natives (chipPiles +
off-kerfurs) and re-creates NEW ones — and the same-world re-seed **deliberately does NOT re-announce / re-bind**
(the anti-dupe suppression, net_pump.cpp:518-526). The save-identity **bind is event-driven** per native load
(`save_identity_bind::OnKeylessLoadSpawn`, via trash_collect_sync.cpp:100); re-loaded placed props fire **no
catchable Init POST** (the reason the re-seed's MarkPropElement tracking exists at all), and the re-seed only
**tracks** the new natives — it never re-runs the **bind**. So after the re-seed the re-created natives are
**tracked but UNBOUND = GHOSTS** (no host mirror → interaction never leaks to the host). The divergence sweep
then sees ~870 unclaimed natives and its **>50% valve correctly aborts** the destroy ([[feedback-join-reconcile-sweep-safety]]),
leaving the ghosts standing.

### Why 16:42 worked and 09:54 didn't — pure ORDERING (engine-GC + drain-speed)
Both runs were same-world re-seed (both logged "NOT re-announcing"). The difference is **when the purge+re-seed
landed relative to the bind/reconcile arm**:

| | 16:42 (worked) | 09:54 (ghost) |
|---|---|---|
| world-ready / bind begins | 16:42:09 | 09:54:57 |
| mass-purge **drain** | **`cap 4096/call`, 2315 in ONE shot (~2s)** via `StaleIndexSelfHeal` (it overlapped the snapshot burst → triggered) | **`cap 256/call`, 256 every ~4s for 37s** (steady reaper only; purge hit AFTER the snapshot, so the fast self-heal never triggered) |
| re-seed completes | 16:42:15 | 09:55:43 |
| divergence sweep ARMED | 16:42:17 (**after** re-seed) | 09:54:59 (**before** purge) |
| sweep FIRES (on quiescence) | 16:42:19 → kerfur retire **1/1** | 09:55:45 → kerfur retire **0/1**, b3 corrections never APPLIED |

**The sweep fired CORRECTLY on quiescence in BOTH** (not the hard deadline — my first read said "45s hard
deadline"; that was wrong, the reason logged is "load tail quiesced"). At 16:42 the fast drain made the re-seed
land early, so the bind/reconcile settled on the **post-re-seed** world → everything matched. At 09:54 the slow
drain pushed the re-seed 37s late, **after** the bind/reconcile had already keyed on the pre-purge world → the
re-seed orphaned the bound natives → ghosts; the user waited 45s, saw a half-reconciled world, and closed at 48s.

### b3 is innocent (code + log)
b3 touches no reaper/GC/kerfur/bind code. Its only log actions: HOST sent 2 correct corrections (eids 4438/5273,
right positions — host-detect works), CLIENT armed both (client-arm works). It spawned/retired/bound nothing.
b3's apply never ran usefully because its target eids were purged+re-seeded under it (same root). Rolling back b3
would NOT fix the ghost (the purge orphans the bind with or without b3; 16:42 only worked by lucky fast-drain
timing). b3 is a **victim**, not a cause — it unblocks the moment the bind survives the re-seed.

## 2. Fix design — two levers (recommend BOTH; (b) is the correctness root, (a) makes it fast + shrinks the race)

### (a) Reaper escalation — drain a mass-purge backlog FAST (net_pump.cpp:360-461)
The steady reaper runs once per **4 s** (sNextReap throttle), reaping `kReapEvictCap = 256`/call; the episode-end
re-seed only runs when a scan reaps `< kReseedPurge (64)` (backlog drained). So a ~2300 backlog drains over
~9 scans × 4 s = **37 s**. The fast path (`StaleIndexSelfHeal`, prop_element_tracker.cpp:557-561, a
`4096`-cap × 8-pass loop) only triggers from the snapshot de-dupe on a stale-fallback — which a post-snapshot
purge misses.
- **Change:** when the reap **hit the cap** (`reaped >= kReapEvictCap` → backlog remains) OR `InPurgeEpisode()`
  is active, **skip the 4 s throttle** — set `sNextReap = reapNow` so the next tick reaps again immediately. The
  backlog then drains at frame cadence (256/frame ≈ 9 frames ≈ ~0.15 s) instead of 256/4 s. Per-call cost stays
  bounded at 256 (no big single-frame hitch); it runs under the join cover (hitches hidden). Episode-end re-seed
  then fires promptly → restores the 16:42 timing. Self-terminating (drains to < cap → throttle resumes).
- **Effect:** the user never waits 45 s; the re-seed lands early; the race window (re-seed-after-arm) shrinks to
  near-zero in the common case. But (a) alone is NOT sufficient — the engine GC fires the purge whenever it wants
  (09:55:06 here, after the bind armed), so a purge can still land after the bind. Hence (b).

### (b) Re-bind after a same-world re-seed — the correctness fix (net_pump.cpp:534-545)
When the episode-end re-seed re-creates the save-authoritative natives, the bind must be **re-run** against the
new natives, WITHOUT a full re-announce/re-snapshot (the anti-dupe suppression must stay).
- **Change:** at the same-world episode-end re-seed (net_pump.cpp:538-545, where `ReSeedKnownKeyedProps()` runs
  and `maybeReAnnounce()` decides NOT to re-announce), additionally invoke a **lightweight re-bind**: re-run
  `save_identity_bind` over the freshly-tracked keyless natives (chipPiles + off-kerfurs) using the **cached
  received ordinal map** (`SetReceivedMap` already holds it), re-mapping per-family ordinal → host eid (Build 3).
  Then **re-arm** the divergence sweep + re-arm the kerfur retire + re-apply the pending b3 corrections, so all
  reconcile adjudicates the post-re-seed world. (b3's `ApplyPendingPosCorrections` is already idempotent + retried
  — re-running it after the re-bind resolves the eids.)
- **Open design points (settle on review / during build):** (i) the exact re-bind entry — does
  `OnKeylessLoadSpawn` re-fire for re-seeded natives, or do we add a `save_identity_bind::RebindAllTracked()`
  that re-enumerates per-family ordinal? (ii) idempotency vs the already-bound survivors (natives whose actor
  survived the purge must NOT double-bind); (iii) ordering — re-bind must precede the divergence sweep's
  unclaimed-destroy so the re-seeded natives are claimed, not doomed.

### (b) COMPLICATION surfaced by the bind RE (2026-06-27, save_identity_bind.cpp read) — the re-bind KEY
`save_identity_bind` (Build 3) keys the bind on **SPAWN ORDER**: the k-th keyless spawn of a family binds to
that family's k-th map entry == saveSlot array index k (RE-proven: within-array spawn order == array index by
construction). `OnKeylessLoadSpawn` advances a per-family **cursor** (`g_chipCursor`/`g_kerfurCursor`); after the
initial bind the cursors sit at `fam.size()` (all consumed), so naively re-firing `OnKeylessLoadSpawn` overflows
(the `cursor >= fam.size()` guard → "NOT binding"). **After a re-seed the spawn order is GONE** — the re-seeded
natives exist as a SET, but a fresh `GUObjectArray` walk is in object-index order, NOT saveSlot/array-index order
(recycled slots), so the ordinal→native correspondence the bind relies on can't be re-derived from a walk. So a
`RebindAllTracked()` cannot simply re-walk + re-assign ordinals.
**Idempotency is fine** (`OnKeylessLoadSpawn` early-returns on `IsBoundMirrorNative(newActor)`; survivors stay
bound, only the new re-seeded natives need binding) — the hard part is purely the KEY for the new ones.
**Re-bind key options (decide on build):**
1. **Position-keyed re-bind** — both peers loaded the SAME save → a re-seeded native sits at its save position;
   the host eid's save-time position is known (`save_transfer` map / the host map). Bind the re-seeded native to
   the eid whose save position it matches (1cm). This is the pre-Build-3 position-adopt approach; its known
   weakness is co-located piles (>1 within 1cm → ambiguous). docs/piles: "piles deterministic → position is a
   key" — acceptable with the ambiguous-skip + the leftover handled by the divergence sweep.
2. **Re-seed preserves spawn order** — make `ReSeedKnownKeyedProps` (or a parallel pass) enumerate the re-loaded
   natives in load order and feed `OnKeylessLoadSpawn` (reset cursors first), IF the BP re-load loop is
   synchronous/deterministic like the initial load (it is — same `loadObjects` path). Needs verifying the
   re-seed sees them in array-index order (the re-load loop order), which the initial-load RE supports but the
   GUObjectArray walk does not preserve — so this likely needs a load-order capture, not a walk.
3. **Capture the ordinal at first bind** — store, per host eid at the initial bind, a STABLE re-find key (the
   save position is the only cross-peer-stable one for a keyless pile), then on re-seed re-bind by that key.
   (Converges with option 1.)
### (b) RE update 2026-06-27 (3 parallel RE traces) — a THIRD option, and option 1's hidden cost
Three read-only RE traces refined the fork. Summary:

- **Option 2 (ordinal re-derivation via the re-seed walk) is DEAD.** `ReSeedKnownKeyedProps` ->
  `SeedWalk_` (prop_element_tracker.cpp:606-619) enumerates in **GUObjectArray object-index order**, NOT saveSlot
  array order; for purge-recycled slots the two are unrelated. The ordinal was never stored — it was a transient
  consumed by the per-family cursor during the BP load loop. A walk cannot recover it. Proven, not reachable.

- **Option 1 (position-keyed re-bind) is moved-pile-SAFE but NOT free — it needs a WIRE EXTENSION.** The
  save<->save match IS the right identity shape and the user's moved-pile worry does NOT apply: the re-bind only
  assigns eid identity; the host's moved/current position is delivered SEPARATELY by eid via b3
  `ApplyPendingPosCorrections` AFTER the bind (pile_reconcile.cpp:398-409). BUT the **client has no per-eid
  save-time position to match against**: the sidecar `IdEntry` carries `{index, eid, family}` only
  (save_identity_map.h:37-41); `g_blobPileXforms` is **host-side, keyed by host eid, never transmitted**
  (save_transfer.cpp:116-117). So option 1 requires **adding an FVector to `IdEntry` + bumping the sidecar
  version**, host-populated from the byLoc data `BuildHostMap` already computes. Co-located piles (>1 within 1cm)
  -> ambiguous -> **skip** (safe: chipPile is doom-exempt from the divergence sweep, remote_prop_spawn.cpp:1491,
  and the >50% valve protects), leaving that one pile a ghost — the bounded residual.

- **Option 3 (cursor-reset — re-fire the PROVEN per-spawn bind) is NEW and, if a probe confirms it, STRICTLY
  BEST (zero wire change, reuses Build 3 ordinal, no position ambiguity).** The crux RE: the natives are
  re-created during the episode by the **game's own `loadObjects`/Load-Primitives BP loop deferred-spawning each
  pile** (docs/piles/README.md:81; the same-world "Load Primitives re-run" destroys+respawns the natives) — the
  **exact same deferred-spawn path the original bind catches** at `OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve`
  (trash_collect_sync.cpp:79-105, a `BeginDeferredActorSpawnFromClass` Func-patch; save_identity_bind.h:7-9
  "1A-proved to catch every keyless load-spawn"). That seam has **no `InPurgeEpisode` gate** — so it fires for
  each re-created native. The 09:54 ghost is then precisely explained: in a LATE purge the per-family cursors are
  already at `fam.size()` (consumed by the first load's bind), so the seam's `OnKeylessLoadSpawn` re-fires but
  hits the overflow guard (`cursor >= size` -> "NOT binding") -> the re-spawns don't bind -> ghosts. **Fix:
  RESET the per-family cursors (g_chipCursor/g_kerfurCursor = 0, map NOT cleared) at purge-episode START so the
  existing seam re-consumes the re-spawned natives in array order** — the identical Build-3 ordinal bind, no
  wire change, no position match. `IsBoundMirrorNative` (save_identity_bind.cpp:182) keeps purge-surviving
  bound natives from double-binding.

  **The ONE unproven assumption (the probe target, per [[feedback-probe-dont-guess-rule]]):** does the
  cursor-reset land BEFORE the first re-spawn fires the seam? The reaper detects the episode on a TICK *after*
  the purge began; if Load Primitives destroys+respawns within the same BP burst, some re-spawns could fire the
  seam before our reset. **Read-only probe:** a `[BIND-PROBE]` log in `OnBeginDeferredSpawnObserve`
  (trash_collect_sync.cpp ~:94) gated on `InPurgeEpisode()`, logging fam + the live cursor value per fire. Run
  the 09:54 repro. **If `[BIND-PROBE]` lines appear during the episode with cursors that a reset would re-consume
  -> option 3 confirmed (cursor-reset, zero wire change). If zero fires (or re-spawns precede any possible reset)
  -> fall back to option 1 (position wire-extension).** The probe is read-only diagnosis (RULE-2-exempt) and
  decides the whole fork; bundle it with lever (a)'s deploy so the next hands-on settles it.

**Recommendation: PROBE option 3 before committing to a design** — it is the most-native, lowest-cost fix IF the
ordering holds, and only a runtime measurement can confirm the ordering (the head-freeze clamp was REFUTED by
exactly this kind of probe; do not guess). Option 1 is the proven fallback if the probe refutes option 3.
**Lever (a) is unaffected, built + committed (`bfe9182a`), and independently useful** — its fast drain also
shrinks the window in which a re-spawn could precede the reset, helping option 3.

### Why both
(b) is the root: the reconcile must bind the FINAL (post-re-seed) world, regardless of purge timing — this fixes
the ghost deterministically. (a) makes the purge fast so the user never sees a 45 s broken world AND shrinks the
window where a late purge can orphan the bind. (a) without (b) = fast but still races a late GC purge; (b) without
(a) = correct but the user still waits up to ~45 s for the slow drain. Together = fast + correct, matching 16:42.

## 2.5 PROBE RESULT (11:32 hands-on, 2026-06-27) — VERDICT: OPTION 3, with one design refinement

Logs: `research/purgeprobe_11-32_{host,client}_2026-06-27.log` (deployed SHA 258A8F0D = lever (a) + [BIND-PROBE]).
Client timeline: bind ARMED 11:31:49 (874 map, cursors->870/4) · mass-purge detected 11:32:01 · **re-seed added 2999
the SAME SECOND** · kerfurOff `keyless spawn beyond` 11:32:04 (+ kerfur retire 1/1, census 0 unclaimed) · chipPile
`keyless spawn beyond` 11:32:19 · divergence sweep fired 11:32:04 · b3 armed eid 4436 but NEVER applied.

**(a) CONFIRMED working:** the mass-purge -> re-seed gap collapsed from **37 s (09:54) to <1 s (11:32)**. The
reaper escalation drains the backlog at frame cadence as designed. KEEP it.

**(a) does NOT fix the pile ghost (as designed):** the chipPile `keyless spawn beyond the mapped 870` at 11:32:19
proves the re-created piles still hit the exhausted cursor and DON'T bind = ghosts. (a) is timing; (b) is the
correctness fix — confirmed.

**[BIND-PROBE] logged ZERO — but NOT because the seam is silent.** Lever (a) collapsed the `InPurgeEpisode`
window to <1 s (re-seed completes the same second the purge is detected), while the re-created natives fire the
bind seam over the NEXT ~18 s (kerfur :04, chip :19 — the Load-Primitives respawn TRICKLES in, it is not
instantaneous). So the `InPurgeEpisode`-gated probe never overlapped the re-spawns. **The probe and the fix it
shipped with interfered.** Honest miss in the probe gate; salvaged below.

**The question is ANSWERED by the pre-existing overflow instrumentation:** the `keyless spawn beyond the mapped`
lines (save_identity_bind.cpp:196) ARE `OnKeylessLoadSpawn` firing for re-created natives. That branch sits
**after** the `IsBoundMirrorNative` survivor early-return (line 182), so a native reaching it is a **fresh
actor with the cursor exhausted** — i.e. `survivor=0 exhausted=1`. **This is option 3's signature: the re-create
DOES go through the bind seam, fresh, with the cursor consumed by the first load.** => **VERDICT: OPTION 3
(cursor-reset). Option 1 (wire-extension) is NOT needed. The seam fires; no position channel required.**

### Option-3 design (refined by the 11:32 evidence) — all ZERO wire change
1. **At mass-purge episode-START** (net_pump.cpp:530, `SetInPurgeEpisode(true)`), call a new
   `save_identity_bind::ResetForReseed()` that (i) resets the per-family cursors (`g_chipCursor=g_kerfurCursor=0`,
   map + entries untouched) AND (ii) clears the bound-mirror flags of the purged natives. The cursor-reset lets
   the fresh exhausted-cursor re-creates (proven at :04/:19) rebind via the proven Build-3 ordinal. The
   flag-clear covers the un-ruled-out **silent** case: a re-create landing at a RECYCLED address of a
   just-destroyed bound native would hit `IsBoundMirrorNative==true` and early-return (NO log — invisible in the
   11:32 run), so clearing the flags ensures those rebind too. The 11:32 log proves the fresh half directly and
   cannot rule out the recycled half, so the robust fix does BOTH (cheap, safe: at a mass purge ALL bound natives
   are in the purge, so clearing all bound flags orphans nothing).
2. **Re-arm AFTER the re-create TRICKLE finishes, not at the early quiescence.** 11:32 shows the divergence sweep
   fired at :04 while chip re-creates were still spawning until :19, and b3 (eid 4436) armed but never applied
   because its target was mid-re-create. So the re-bind + divergence sweep + kerfur-retire + b3
   `ApplyPendingPosCorrections` must adjudicate the world AFTER the Load-Primitives respawn settles (the
   quiescence gate must not declare "load tail quiesced" while keyless re-spawns are still arriving — gate it on
   the per-family spawn count reaching the mapped count, or on a no-new-keyless-spawn dwell). This is the
   `[[feedback-snapshot-before-state-ready]]` class again: the sweep snapshotted before the re-create was ready.
3. **Array-order correctness:** the re-create is the same Load-Primitives loop (objectsData then primitivesData),
   so within each family the k-th re-spawn == array index k — the cursor-reset rebind maps correctly (the same
   invariant Build 3 relies on). The :04-kerfur-before-:19-chip ordering matches objectsData-before-primitivesData.

**Open points for the (b) design doc (settle on review):** the exact re-arm trigger (spawn-count-complete vs
dwell), whether `ResetForReseed` clears the bind tallies (cosmetic) too, and whether the [BIND-PROBE] gate should
widen (drop `InPurgeEpisode`, gate on `armed && cursor>=size`) for a clean confirmation run — likely unnecessary
since the overflow lines already prove it.

## 2.6 12:29 HANDS-ON: VARIANT 3 REFUTED (mis-bind) -> fall back to VARIANT 1 (position-key)

Logs: `research/purgefix_12-29_{host,client}_2026-06-27.log` (deployed SHA 2663BD72 = lever (a) + (b) cursor-reset).
Symptoms: (1) client turns ONE kerfur on -> TWO activate (kerfurs sharing identity); (2) client grabs a LOCAL pile
-> it turns BLACK / wrong type (bound to a FOREIGN eid). Both = mis-bind.

**Proven root -- the re-create is a SPARSE SUBSET, not a full array-order batch:**
- 12:30:05 first load bound IN ORDER: k=0->eid 4435, k=1->4434, k=2->4433 ... (cursors 870/4, 874 bound).
- 12:30:09 mass-purge -> RESET-FOR-RESEED (cursors->0, ALL 874 bound-mirror flags cleared) + sweep re-arm.
- 12:30:14 **exactly ONE** chipPile re-fired the seam: `[BIND-PROBE] re-create #1 cursor=0/870` -> `BOUND k=0 ->
  eid 4435 [case(i) fresh mirror]`. The lone re-create bound to **entry[0]=4435** because the cursor was reset to 0.
- 12:30:25 `SETTLED chip 1/870 kerfur 0/4 (no-progress-dwell)`; `BIND SUMMARY bound 875/874, cursors chip=1 kerfur=0`.
- `re-seed found 871 keyless chipPile, added 0 NEW` = the 869 other piles + 4 kerfurs **SURVIVED** (re-tracked,
  not re-spawned); they kept their correct first-load binds.

So **Part 3 (k-th re-spawn == array index k) is FALSE for the re-create**: only a SPARSE subset re-creates (1 of
870 here; 2 at 09:54/11:32 -- the `overflow=2` I misread as "bulk fires"), so resetting the cursor to 0 binds the
k-th re-spawn to entry[k] -- but the k-th re-spawn is an arbitrary array index, so it gets the WRONG eid (the lone
re-create -> 4435 -> a foreign identity = the black pile). The whole of variant 3 stood on this unproven invariant
(the probe couldn't confirm it -- lever (a) broke the gate); 12:29 disproves it. **Variant 3 REFUTED.**

**Bonus damage:** ResetForReseed cleared ALL 874 bound-mirror flags though ~1 native re-created -- the 869+4
survivors lost flags needlessly; the kerfur cursor stayed 0 (no kerfur re-bind), so the two-kerfurs-one-input is
the flag-clear side effect, not a cursor mis-bind. Reverting (b) removes it.

**VERDICT: revert (b)'s cursor-reset + flag-clear + reseed gate + sweep re-arm (parts 1+2); KEEP lever (a)
(independent, drain 37s->1s, confirmed 11:32); design VARIANT 1 (position-key), which is ORDER- and
COUNT-independent so a sparse subset re-creating is fine.**

### Variant 1 direction (design on review, NOT built)
The bulk (869/870) SURVIVE with correct binds; only the sparse re-creates (the OLD overflow-drop path = the
09:54/11:32 ghosts) need re-binding. So: on a **past-cursor (re-create) seam fire** -- the existing
`cursor >= fam.size()` overflow branch in OnKeylessLoadSpawn -- instead of DROPPING it, **position-match the
re-create to its correct eid and bind** (no cursor reset, no flag clear, surviving binds untouched). Each
re-create matches its OWN save position -> its OWN eid, regardless of order/count.
- **Enabler (eid -> save position):** capturable **client-side at first-load bind** (store
  `g_eidSavePos[eid] = GetActorLocation(native)` in BindLocalNativeToHostEid_, since the first-load native sits
  at its save position) -- so likely **NO wire-extension needed** (better than the originally-scoped +FVector on
  IdEntry; settle on review). A moved-in-window pile's re-create is at SAVE pos on the client (it doesn't know the
  host moved it) -> matches save-pos -> correct eid; b3 delivers the moved position separately.
- **Co-located ambiguity** (>1 pile within ~1cm of the same save pos): ambiguous -> skip (the rare residual stays
  a ghost; the divergence sweep's chipPile-exemption keeps it from being wrongly destroyed). This is the same
  weakness Build 3 left position-adopt for -- acceptable for the sparse re-create minority.
- Open design points (settle on review): exact match tolerance, whether to ALSO handle the kerfur family by
  position (only 4, co-location unlikely), and whether the b3 PendingPosCorrection apply still works (it resolves
  by eid via the registry -- unaffected, since the re-create now binds to the correct eid).

## 3. b3 stays (unblocked by the fix)
b3's host-detect + client-arm are log-verified correct; only its apply is unverified (blocked by the purge). With
(b) the bind survives the re-seed → the sweep adjudicates a stable world → b3 corrections + kerfur retire + mirror
reveal all apply. Do NOT roll back b3.

## 4. Verify gate (after build)
Reproduce a slow/late purge join (like 09:54 — move piles EARLY + turn a kerfur on, join). Expect: the purge
drains fast (no 37 s 256/4 s crawl — a `[reaper]` fast-drain marker), the re-seed re-binds (a re-bind log line,
bound N/N on the post-re-seed natives), the sweep fires on quiescence in ~10 s, NO ghost piles/kerfur (interaction
leaks to host), b3 corrections APPLIED (drift log), kerfur retire matches. #1/#2/b2 unregressed; clean-join
unaffected.
